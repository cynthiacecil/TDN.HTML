    <h1> Tech Diversity In Nigeria</h1>
    <p>(2024 edition)</p>
    <p> Our goal is to create a renewed sense of purpose through digital education. <br>
         Train 100,000 people and place 20% into direct jobs. <br>
         This will create wealth for families locked out of employment opportunities. <br> 
         Become a beneficiary!
